                    No, it isn't. It is bad practice for normal web content. For web apps, the default zoom behavior can completely ruin usability. For example, nobody wants to zoom in on a channel up button because they tapped it twice, nor zoom in on part of a video game because they tapped the jump button twice. There's a reason that this feature was added in the first place, and it makes no sense to break usability for everybody just because a few "web designers" don't know what they're doing. Go scream at the site designers and quit breaking the browser. – dgatwood Jan 30 at 8:10No, it isn't. It is bad practice for normal web content.
